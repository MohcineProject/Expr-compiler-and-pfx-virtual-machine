Description of the project
--------------------------

The project is about building a tool that can understand simple math equations and eventually handle 

more complicated ones (functions). Instead of directly translating the equations into the language 

that computers understand, we first translate them into a simpler language that computers can work 

with easily. Then, we run them on a virtual machine. We use two languages for this project: Expr and 

Pfx. We wrote explanations about how everything works in a document using LaTeX. For the coding part,

we tackled basic math operations (the functional part is not working correctly) and checked if they 

work correctly using Dune. The code is organized neatly into folders (for the functions extensions 

check folders named 'fun' for both languages.)

Git repository: https://github.com/MohcineProject/Expr-Compiler-.git

(We did not use the git, we usually worked together in the same pc, thinking about the solution and implementing it)

===============

How to…
-------

…retrieve the sources?

  git clone https://github.com/MohcineProject/Expr-Compiler-.git

…compile and execute ?

  for the pfx programs (that deal with simple stack operations no functions), you can execute 
  programs written in the ok_prog.pfx file, you can modify the pfx code and test the virtual machine. 

   dune exec pfx/pfxVM.exe -- pfx/basic/tests/ok_prog.pfx 

  for the Expr programs, to compile them to pfx and execute them (again with just the simple arithmetic operations)
  we use the file an_example.expr, you can modify the file and write new programs in Expr. 

  dune exec expr/compiler.exe -- expr/basic/tests/an_example.expr



… to test?
  You can also use this command to run tests, however it would not work since we are still having trouble
  in the fun folder. 
  dune utop and then use the libraries

Structure of the project
------------------------

The project is organized as following:

Here we explain the structure of our project

You may also show the file tree as the following example:

Progress
--------

- We stopped at question 12 (we did it)
- There is still a bug in question 10.3 (new version of generate function)
- And also In the extended lexer of pfx (more specifcally, there is a problem with a function to tokenize
  sequence of commands)

===============

Know bugs and issues
--------------------

- One difficulty that took us a lot of time is the new lexer of the pfx : 
We tought about introducing seqences in the form of "Push [ (Sequence)]" But we found several problems 
in the lexer we could not define a proper regexp to catch nested Sequences as in "Push [ ... Push [ ... ] ... ]"
and we were not able to create a function to translate this commands from string to AST element 
(to be more specific it is the function 'tokenize_command_str') 

- Another problem that we encountred is with the new generate function in the fun directory of expr. 
Altough we believe that the logic is correct according to our defined rules of transformation we 
think that we did not handle correctly the recursive feature of the function to update the environment
used to bind variables to their depths. 



===============

Helpful resources
-----------------

- we used this manual to understand more deeply the regexp syntaxe used by ocamllex 
  
  https://caml.inria.fr/pub/old_caml_site/ocaml/htmlman/manual026.html

- We also looked into some other ressources, but the bug usually ended up to be a typo. 

===============

Difficulties
------------

- The project was really beautiful, we enjoyed the realm of functional paradigm, everything seemed coherent
- The problem was not that it was difficult, i genuinely think it is easy. The problem was in understanding
the environment and the syntaxe (dune, regexp, the overall structure ...) they took a good amount of time 
to try to understand them. 
The already written code was very helpfu along the process 

Futur: 
------

Since the project was beautiful we look forward to complete it, you can verify the provided gitlab 
we will be sure also the put the latex document if renewed.
